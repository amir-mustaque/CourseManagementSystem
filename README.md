# CourseManagementSystem

How It Works:
The CourseManagementSystem class allows you to add courses and students.
Students can enroll in courses, and you can display all courses a student is enrolled in.
The main method demonstrates how to create courses, add students, enroll them in courses, and display the courses.

Explanation:
Course.java: Defines a course with attributes like course ID, course name, and credits.
Student.java: Represents a student and maintains a list of courses the student is enrolled in.
CourseManagementSystem.java: Manages courses and students, including adding courses, enrolling students, and displaying enrolled courses.
